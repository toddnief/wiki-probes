A [[Field goal (basketball)|field goal]] is worth two points, unless made from behind the [[3 point line|three-point line]], when it is worth three. After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a [[technical foul]] is given one, two or three one-point [[free throw]]s. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play ([[Overtime (sports)|overtime]]) is mandated.\\n\\nPlayers advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running (dribbling) or by passing it to a teammate, both of which require considerable skill. On offense, players may use a variety of shots{{snd}}the [[layup]], the [[jump shot (basketball)|jump shot]], or a [[Slam dunk|dunk]]; on defense, they may [[Steal (basketball)|steal]] the ball from a dribbler, intercept passes, or [[block (basketball)|block]] shots; either offense or defense may collect a [[rebound (basketball)|rebound]], that is, a missed shot that bounces from rim or backboard. It is a violation to [[Traveling (basketball)|lift or drag one\\'s pivot foot without dribbling the ball]], to [[Carrying (basketball)|carry]] it, or to [[double dribble|hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling]].\\n\\nThe five players on each side fall into five [[Basketball positions|playing positions]]. The tallest player is usually the [[Center (basketball)|center]], the second-tallest and strongest is the [[Power forward (basketball)|power forward]], a slightly shorter but more agile player is the [[small forward]], and the shortest players or the best ball handlers are the [[shooting guard]] and the [[point guard]], who implement the coach\\'s game plan by managing the execution of offensive and defensive plays (player positioning). Informally, players may play three-on-three, two-on-two, and one-on-one.\\n\\nInvented in 1891 by Canadian-American gym teacher [[James Naismith]] in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], in the United States, basketball has evolved to become one of the world\\'s most popular and widely viewed sports.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-11348053|title=The Canadian who invented basketball|access-date=September 14, 2011|date=September 20, 2010|work=BBC News|first=Sian|last=Griffiths|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425025454/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-11348053|archive-date=April 25, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Most watched sports in the world |date=March 13, 2022 |url=https://sportsvirsa.com/most-popular-sports/}}</ref> The [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) is the most significant [[professional basketball]] league in the world in terms of popularity, salaries, talent, and level of competition<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=Forbes.com |title=The Surge of the NBA\\'s International Viewership and Popularity |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/aliciajessop/2012/06/14/the-surge-of-the-nbas-international-viewership-and-popularity/ |date=June 14, 2012 |access-date=June 14, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618104120/http://www.forbes.com/sites/aliciajessop/2012/06/14/the-surge-of-the-nbas-international-viewership-and-popularity/ |archive-date=June 18, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |publisher=SportingIntelligence.com |title=REVEALED: The world\\'s best paid teams, Man City close in on Barca and Real Madrid |url=http://www.sportingintelligence.com/2012/05/01/revealed-the-worlds-best-paid-teams-man-city-close-in-on-barca-and-real-madrid-010501/ |date=May 1, 2012 |access-date=June 11, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616192611/http://www.sportingintelligence.com/2012/05/01/revealed-the-worlds-best-paid-teams-man-city-close-in-on-barca-and-real-madrid-010501/ |archive-date=June 16, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> (drawing most of its talent from U.S. [[college basketball]]).

After rejecting other ideas as either too rough or poorly suited to walled-in [[gymnasiums]], he invented a new game in which players would pass a ball to teammates and try to score points by tossing the ball into a basket mounted on a wall. Naismith wrote the basic [[rules of basketball|rules]] and nailed a [[peach]] basket onto an elevated track. Naismith initially set up the peach basket with its bottom intact, which meant that the ball had to be retrieved manually after each \"basket\" or point scored. This quickly proved tedious, so Naismith removed the bottom of the basket to allow the balls to be poked out with a long [[dowel]] after each scored basket.\\n\\n[[File:Firstbasketball.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The first basketball court: [[Springfield College]]]]\\n[[File:Basketball historic.tif|thumb|upright|left|Old-style basketball with laces]]\\n\\nBasketball was originally played with a [[ball (association football)|soccer ball]].

The first balls made specifically for basketball were brown, and it was only in the late 1950s that [[Paul D. \"Tony\" Hinkle|Tony Hinkle]], searching for a ball that would be more visible to players and spectators alike, introduced the orange ball that is now in common use. Dribbling was not part of the original game except for the \"bounce pass\" to teammates. Passing the ball was the primary means of ball movement.

The ball is out of bounds if it touches a boundary line, or touches any player or object that is out of bounds.\\n\\nThere are limits placed on the steps a player may take without dribbling, which commonly results in an infraction known as [[traveling (basketball)|traveling]]. Nor may a player stop their dribble and then resume dribbling. A dribble that touches both hands is considered stopping the dribble, giving this infraction the name [[double dribble]]. Within a dribble, the player cannot carry the ball by placing their hand on the bottom of the ball; doing so is known as [[Carrying (basketball)|carrying the ball]]. A team, once having established ball control in the front half of their court, may not return the ball to the backcourt and be the first to touch it. A violation of these rules results in loss of possession.\\n\\nThe ball may not be kicked, nor be struck with the fist. For the offense, a violation of these rules results in loss of possession; for the defense, most leagues reset the shot clock and the offensive team is given possession of the ball out of bounds.\\n\\nThere are limits imposed on the time taken before progressing the ball past halfway (8 seconds in FIBA and the NBA; 10 seconds in NCAA and high school for both sexes), before attempting a shot (24 seconds in FIBA, the NBA, and [[U Sports]] (Canadian universities) play for both sexes, and 30 seconds in NCAA play for both sexes), holding the ball while closely guarded (5 seconds), and remaining in the restricted area known as the free-throw lane, (or the \"[[key (basketball)|key]]\") (3 seconds). These rules are designed to promote more offense.\\n\\nThere are also limits on how players may [[block (basketball)|block]] an opponent\\'s field goal attempt or help a teammate\\'s field goal attempt. [[Goaltending]] is a defender\\'s touching of a ball that is on a downward flight toward the basket, while the related violation of [[basket interference]] is the touching of a ball that is on the rim or above the basket, or by a player reaching through the basket from below. Goaltending and basket interference committed by a defender result in awarding the basket to the offense, while basket interference committed by an offensive player results in cancelling the basket if one is scored. The defense gains possession in all cases of goaltending or basket interference.\\n\\n===Fouls===\\n<!-- Please be careful not to include too much detail when editing this section; see talk page for more info. -->\\n[[File:Basketball foul.jpg|thumb|upright|The referee signals that a foul has been committed.]]\\n{{Main|Personal foul (basketball)|Technical foul}}\\nAn attempt to unfairly disadvantage an opponent through certain types of physical contact is illegal and is called a personal foul. These are most commonly committed by defensive players; however, they can be committed by offensive players as well. Players who are fouled either receive the ball to pass inbounds again, or receive one or more [[free throw]]s if they are fouled in the act of shooting, depending on whether the shot was successful. One point is awarded for making a free throw, which is attempted from a line {{convert|15|ft|m}} from the basket.\\n\\nThe referee is responsible for judging whether contact is illegal, sometimes resulting in controversy. The calling of fouls can vary between games, leagues and referees.\\n\\nThere is a second category of fouls called [[technical foul]]s, which may be charged for various rules violations including failure to properly record a player in the scorebook, or for unsportsmanlike conduct. These infractions result in one or two free throws, which may be taken by any of the five players on the court at the time. Repeated incidents can result in [[ejection (sports)|disqualification]]. A blatant foul involving physical contact that is either excessive or unnecessary is called an intentional foul (flagrant foul in the NBA). In FIBA and NCAA women\\'s basketball, a foul resulting in ejection is called a disqualifying foul, while in leagues other than the NBA, such a foul is referred to as flagrant.\\n\\nIf a team exceeds a certain limit of team fouls in a given period (quarter or half) – four for NBA, NCAA women\\'s, and international games – the opposing team is awarded one or two free throws on all subsequent non-shooting fouls for that period, the number depending on the league. In the US college men\\'s game and high school games for both sexes, if a team reaches 7 fouls in a half, the opposing team is awarded one free throw, along with a second shot if the first is made. This is called shooting \"one-and-one\". If a team exceeds 10 fouls in the half, the opposing team is awarded two free throws on all subsequent fouls for the half.\\n\\nWhen a team shoots foul shots, the opponents may not interfere with the shooter, nor may they try to regain possession until the last or potentially last free throw is in the air.\\n\\nAfter a team has committed a specified number of fouls, the other team is said to be \"in the bonus\". On scoreboards, this is usually signified with an indicator light reading \"Bonus\" or \"Penalty\" with an illuminated directional arrow or dot indicating that team is to receive free throws when fouled by the opposing team. (Some scoreboards also indicate the number of fouls committed.)\\n\\nIf a team misses the first shot of a two-shot situation, the opposing team must wait for the completion of the second shot before attempting to reclaim possession of the ball and continuing play.\\n\\nIf a player is fouled while attempting a shot and the shot is unsuccessful, the player is awarded a number of free throws equal to the value of the attempted shot. A player fouled while attempting a regular two-point shot thus receives two shots, and a player fouled while attempting a three-point shot receives three shots.\\n\\nIf a player is fouled while attempting a shot and the shot is successful, typically the player will be awarded one additional free throw for one point. In combination with a regular shot, this is called a \"three-point play\" or \"four-point play\" (or more colloquially, an \"and one\") because of the basket made at the time of the foul (2 or 3 points) and the additional free throw (1 point).\\n \\t\\n[[File:Foul plus basket.ogg|thumb|A foul committed during a shot attempt]]\\n\\n==Common techniques and practices==\\n\\n===Positions===\\n{{main|Basketball positions}}\\n[[File:Basketball positions.svg|thumb|upright=1.15|Basketball positions in the offensive zone]]\\nAlthough the rules do not specify any positions whatsoever, they have evolved as part of basketball. During the early years of basketball\\'s evolution, two guards, two forwards, and one center were used. In more recent times specific positions evolved, but the current trend, advocated by many top coaches including [[Mike Krzyzewski]], is towards positionless basketball, where big players are free to shoot from outside and dribble if their skill allows it.<ref name=\"Positionless Basketball\">{{cite web|last1=Marshall|first1=John|title=Positionless basketball taking hold in college|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/0af6adb8a9764142a1dae795bb22d6d3/positionless-basketball-taking-hold-college|access-date=November 18, 2014|date=November 1, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129083230/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/0af6adb8a9764142a1dae795bb22d6d3/positionless-basketball-taking-hold-college|archive-date=November 29, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> Popular descriptions of positions include:\\n\\n[[Point guard]] (often called the \"\\'\\'\\'1\\'\\'\\'\") : usually the fastest player on the team, organizes the team\\'s offense by controlling the ball and making sure that it gets to the right player at the right time.\\n\\n[[Shooting guard]] (the \"\\'\\'\\'2\\'\\'\\'\") : creates a high volume of shots on offense, mainly long-ranged; and guards the opponent\\'s best perimeter player on defense.\\n\\n[[Small forward]] (the \"\\'\\'\\'3\\'\\'\\'\") : often primarily responsible for scoring points via cuts to the basket and dribble penetration; on defense seeks rebounds and steals, but sometimes plays more actively.\\n\\n[[Power forward (basketball)|Power forward]] (the \"\\'\\'\\'4\\'\\'\\'\"): plays offensively often with their back to the basket; on defense, plays under the basket (in a zone defense) or against the opposing power forward (in [[man-to-man defense]]).\\n\\n[[Center (basketball)|Center]] (the \"\\'\\'\\'5\\'\\'\\'\"): uses height and size to score (on offense), to protect the basket closely (on defense), or to rebound.\\n\\nThe above descriptions are flexible. For most teams today, the shooting guard and small forward have very similar responsibilities and are often called \\'\\'\\'the wings\\'\\'\\', as do the power forward and center, who are often called \\'\\'\\'post players.\\'\\'\\' While most teams describe two players as guards, two as forwards, and one as a center, on some occasions teams choose to call them by different designations.\\n\\n===Strategy===\\n{{main|Basketball playbook}}\\n\\nThere are two main defensive strategies: \\'\\'zone defense\\'\\' and \\'\\'man-to-man defense\\'\\'. In a [[zone defense]], each player is assigned to guard a specific area of the court. Zone defenses often allow the defense to double team the ball, a manoeuver known as a \\'\\'\\'trap\\'\\'\\'. In a [[man-to-man defense]], each defensive player guards a specific opponent.\\n\\nOffensive plays are more varied, normally involving planned passes and movement by players without the ball. A quick movement by an offensive player without the ball to gain an advantageous position is known as a \\'\\'cut\\'\\'. A legal attempt by an offensive player to stop an opponent from guarding a teammate, by standing in the defender\\'s way such that the teammate cuts next to him, is a \\'\\'[[screen (basketball)|screen]]\\'\\' or \\'\\'pick\\'\\'. The two plays are combined in the \\'\\'[[pick and roll]]\\'\\', in which a player sets a pick and then \"rolls\" away from the pick towards the basket. Screens and cuts are very important in offensive plays; these allow the quick passes and teamwork, which can lead to a successful basket. Teams almost always have several offensive plays planned to ensure their movement is not predictable. On court, the point guard is usually responsible for indicating which play will occur.\\n\\n===Shooting===\\n[[File:Basketball shot.jpg|thumb|upright|Player releases a short jump shot, while her defender is either knocked down, or trying to \"take a charge\".]]\\n\\nShooting is the act of attempting to score points by throwing the ball through the basket, methods varying with players and situations.\\n\\nTypically, a player faces the basket with both feet facing the basket. A player will rest the ball on the fingertips of the dominant hand (the shooting arm) slightly above the head, with the other hand supporting the side of the ball. The ball is usually shot by jumping (though not always) and extending the shooting arm. The shooting arm, fully extended with the wrist fully bent, is held stationary for a moment following the release of the ball, known as a \\'\\'follow-through\\'\\'. Players often try to put a steady backspin on the ball to absorb its impact with the rim. The ideal trajectory of the shot is somewhat controversial, but generally a proper arc is recommended. Players may shoot directly into the basket or may use the backboard to redirect the ball into the basket.\\n\\n[[File:Basketball through hoop.jpg|thumb|left|Basketball falling through hoop]]\\n\\nThe two most common shots that use the above described setup are the \\'\\'[[set shot (basketball)|set shot]]\\'\\' and the \\'\\'[[Jump shot (basketball)|jump shot]]\\'\\'. Both are preceded by a crouching action which [[Isometric exercise#Isometric presses as preparation for explosive power movements|preloads]] the muscles and increases the power of the shot. In a set shot, the shooter straightens up and throws from a standing position with neither foot leaving the floor; this is typically used for free throws. For a jump shot, the throw is taken in mid-air with the ball being released near the top of the jump. This provides much greater power and range, and it also allows the player to elevate over the defender. Failure to release the ball before the feet return to the floor is considered a traveling violation.\\n\\nAnother common shot is called the \\'\\'[[layup]]\\'\\'. This shot requires the player to be in motion toward the basket, and to \"lay\" the ball \"up\" and into the basket, typically off the backboard (the backboard-free, underhand version is called a \\'\\'[[finger roll]]\\'\\'). The most crowd-pleasing and typically highest-percentage accuracy shot is the \\'\\'[[slam dunk]]\\'\\', in which the player jumps very high and throws the ball downward, through the basket while touching it.\\n\\n[[File:Dunk.gif|thumb|Slow-motion animation of a dunk]]\\n\\nAnother shot that is less common than the layup, is the \"circus shot\". The circus shot is a low-percentage shot that is flipped, heaved, scooped, or flung toward the hoop while the shooter is off-balance, airborne, falling down or facing away from the basket. A back-shot is a shot taken when the player is facing away from the basket, and may be shot with the dominant hand, or both; but there is a very low chance that the shot will be successful.<ref>{{Cite web|date=November 17, 2016|title=WATCH: Curry pulls off circus shot and gets a foul|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/sports/11/17/16/watch-curry-pulls-off-circus-shot-and-gets-a-foul|access-date=January 8, 2021|website=ABS-CBN News|language=en}}</ref>\\n\\nA shot that misses both the rim and the backboard completely is referred to as an \\'\\'[[air ball]]\\'\\'. A particularly bad shot, or one that only hits the backboard, is jocularly called a [[brick (basketball)|brick]]. The \\'\\'hang time\\'\\' is the length of time a player stays in the air after jumping, either to make a slam dunk, layup or jump shot.\\n\\n===Rebounding===\\n{{Main|Rebound (basketball)}}\\n[[File:20130103 Offensive Rebound Glenn Robinson III rebound.jpg|upright|thumb|A player making an offensive rebound]]\\n<!-- There should be at least a paragraph or two here, in addition to the main article link. -->\\nThe objective of rebounding is to successfully gain possession of the basketball after a missed field goal or free throw, as it rebounds from the hoop or backboard. This plays a major role in the game, as most possessions end when a team misses a shot. There are two categories of rebounds: offensive rebounds, in which the ball is recovered by the offensive side and does not change possession, and defensive rebounds, in which the defending team gains possession of the loose ball. The majority of rebounds are defensive, as the team on defense tends to be in better position to recover missed shots; for example, about 75% of rebounds in the NBA are defensive.<ref>{{Cite web |title=2022–23 NBA Season Summary |url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2023.html |access-date=2023-04-18 |website=Basketball-Reference.com |language=en}}</ref>\\n\\n===Passing===\\n<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:172808 480 art R0.jpg|thumb|left|[[Carlos Arroyo]] shown here with the [[Utah Jazz]], left, passes to a teammate.{{Deletable image-caption|2006-10-16|date=May 2012}} ]] -->\\n{{See also|Assist (basketball)}}\\nA pass is a method of moving the ball between players. Most passes are accompanied by a step forward to increase power and are followed through with the hands to ensure accuracy.\\n\\nA staple pass is the \\'\\'chest pass\\'\\'. The ball is passed directly from the passer\\'s chest to the receiver\\'s chest. A proper chest pass involves an outward snap of the thumbs to add velocity and leaves the defence little time to react.\\n\\nAnother type of pass is the \\'\\'bounce pass\\'\\'. Here, the passer bounces the ball crisply about two-thirds of the way from his own chest to the receiver. The ball strikes the court and bounces up toward the receiver. The bounce pass takes longer to complete than the chest pass, but it is also harder for the opposing team to intercept (kicking the ball deliberately is a violation). Thus, players often use the bounce pass in crowded moments, or to pass around a defender.\\n\\nThe \\'\\'overhead pass\\'\\' is used to pass the ball over a defender. The ball is released while over the passer\\'s head.\\n\\nThe \\'\\'outlet pass\\'\\' occurs after a team gets a defensive rebound. The next pass after the rebound is the \\'\\'outlet pass\\'\\'.\\n\\nThe crucial aspect of any good pass is it being difficult to intercept. Good passers can pass the ball with great accuracy and they know exactly where each of their other teammates prefers to receive the ball. A special way of doing this is passing the ball without looking at the receiving teammate. This is called a \\'\\'no-look pass\\'\\'.\\n\\nAnother advanced style of passing is the \\'\\'behind-the-back pass\\'\\', which, as the description implies, involves throwing the ball behind the passer\\'s back to a teammate. Although some players can perform such a pass effectively, many coaches discourage no-look or behind-the-back passes, believing them to be difficult to control and more likely to result in turnovers or violations.\\n\\n===Dribbling===\\n[[File:Basketball-Basic Types of Dribbling.webm|thumb|right|upright=1.45|A demonstration of the basic types of dribbling in basketball]]\\n[[File:Basketball game.jpg|thumb|upright|A U.S. Naval Academy (\"Navy\") player, left, posts up a U.S. Military Academy (\"Army\") defender.]]\\n{{Main|Dribble}}\\nDribbling is the act of bouncing the ball continuously with one hand and is a requirement for a player to take steps with the ball. To dribble, a player pushes the ball down towards the ground with the fingertips rather than patting it; this ensures greater control.\\n\\nWhen dribbling past an opponent, the dribbler should dribble with the hand farthest from the opponent, making it more difficult for the defensive player to get to the ball. It is therefore important for a player to be able to dribble competently with both hands.\\n\\nGood dribblers (or \"ball handlers\") tend to keep their dribbling hand low to the ground, reducing the distance of travel of the ball from the floor to the hand, making it more difficult for the defender to \"steal\" the ball. Good ball handlers frequently dribble behind their backs, between their legs, and switch directions suddenly, making a less predictable dribbling pattern that is more difficult to defend against. This is called a [[crossover dribble|crossover]], which is the most effective way to move past defenders while dribbling.\\n\\nA skilled player can dribble without watching the ball, using the dribbling motion or [[peripheral vision]] to keep track of the ball\\'s location. By not having to focus on the ball, a player can look for teammates or scoring opportunities, as well as avoid the danger of having someone steal the ball away from him/her.\\n\\n===Blocking===\\n{{Main|Block (basketball)}}\\nA block is performed when, after a shot is attempted, a defender succeeds in altering the shot by touching the ball. In almost all variants of play, it is illegal to touch the ball after it is in the downward path of its arc; this is known as \\'\\'[[goaltending]]\\'\\'. It is also illegal under NBA and Men\\'s NCAA basketball to block a shot after it has touched the backboard, or when any part of the ball is directly above the rim. Under international rules it is illegal to block a shot that is in the downward path of its arc or one that has touched the backboard until the ball has hit the rim. After the ball hits the rim, it is again legal to touch it even though it is no longer considered as a block performed.\\n\\nTo block a shot, a player has to be able to reach a point higher than where the shot is released. Thus, height can be an advantage in blocking. Players who are taller and playing the power forward or center positions generally record more blocks than players who are shorter and playing the guard positions. However, with good timing and a sufficiently high vertical leap, even shorter players can be effective shot blockers.\\n\\n==Height==\\n[[File:Joonas Suotamo.jpg|thumb|[[Joonas Suotamo]], a Finnish-American former professional center, is {{convert|6|ft|11|in|m|2}} tall. Many professional centers\\' heights exceed {{convert|7|ft|m|2}}.]]\\nAt the professional level, most male players are above {{convert|6|ft|3|in|m|2}} and most women above {{convert|5|ft|7|in|m|2}}. Guards, for whom physical coordination and ball-handling skills are crucial, tend to be the smallest players. Almost all forwards in the top men\\'s pro leagues are {{convert|6|ft|6|in|m|2}} or taller. Most centers are over {{convert|6|ft|10|in|m|2}} tall. According to a survey given to all NBA teams,{{when|date=July 2015}} the average height of all NBA players is just under {{convert|6|ft|7|in|m|2}}, with the average weight being close to {{convert|222|lb|kg}}.

At {{convert|7|ft|2|in|m|2}}, [[Margo Dydek]] was the tallest player in the history of the WNBA.\\n\\nThe shortest player ever to play in the NBA is [[Muggsy Bogues]] at {{convert|5|ft|3|in|m|2}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/playerfile/muggsy_bogues/bio.html |title=Muggsy Bogues Bio |work=NBA.com |access-date=July 25, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100717083745/http://www.nba.com/playerfile/muggsy_bogues/bio.html |archive-date=July 17, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Other average-height or relatively short players have thrived at the pro level, including [[Spud Webb|Anthony \"Spud\" Webb]], who was {{convert|5|ft|7|in|m}} tall, but had a {{convert|42|in|m|adj=on}} vertical leap, giving him significant height when jumping, and [[Temeka Johnson]], who won the [[WNBA Rookie of the Year Award]] and a championship with the [[Phoenix Mercury]] while standing only {{convert|5|ft|3|in|m}}. While shorter players are often at a disadvantage in certain aspects of the game, their ability to navigate quickly through crowded areas of the court and steal the ball by reaching low are strengths.\\n\\nPlayers regularly inflate their height in high school or college. Many prospects exaggerate their height while in high school or college to make themselves more appealing to coaches and scouts, who prefer taller players. Charles Barkley stated; \"I\\'ve been measured at 6–5, 6-{{frac|4|3|4}}. But I started in college at 6–6.\" Sam Smith, a former writer from the \\'\\'[[Chicago Tribune]]\\'\\', said: \"We sort of know the heights, because after camp, the sheet comes out. But you use that height, and the player gets mad. And then you hear from his agent.

Some variations only have superficial rule changes, while others are distinct games with varying degrees of influence from basketball. Other variations include children\\'s games, contests or activities meant to help players reinforce skills.\\n\\nAn earlier version of basketball, played primarily by women and girls, was [[six-on-six basketball]]. [[Horseball]] is a game played on horseback where a ball is handled and points are scored by shooting it through a high net (approximately 1.5m×1.5m). The sport is like a combination of [[polo]], [[rugby football|rugby]], and basketball. There is even a form played on donkeys known as [[Donkey basketball]], which has attracted criticism from animal rights groups.\\n\\n=== Half-court ===\\nPerhaps the single most common variation of basketball is the half-court game, played in informal settings without referees or strict rules. Only one basket is used, and the ball must be \"taken back\" or \"cleared\" – passed or dribbled outside the three-point line each time possession of the ball changes from one team to the other. Half-court games require less [[cardiovascular]] stamina, since players need not run back and forth a full court. Half-court raises the number of players that can use a court or, conversely, can be played if there is an insufficient number to form full 5-on-5 teams.\\n\\nHalf-court basketball is usually played 1-on-1, 2-on-2 or 3-on-3. The latter variation is gradually gaining official recognition as [[3x3 (basketball)|3x3]], originally known as FIBA 33. It was first tested at the [[2007 Asian Indoor Games]] in [[Macau]] and the first official tournaments were held at the [[2009 Asian Youth Games]] and the [[2010 Youth Olympics]], both in Singapore.
